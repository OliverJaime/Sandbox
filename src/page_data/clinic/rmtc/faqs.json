      "question": "HOW MANY SESSIONS ARE NEEDED?",
      "answer": "RPT is momentum-based. We recommend weekly visits until your pain subsides. Most people feel noticeable relief after the first session. Long-term chronic pain usually requires more sessions than more recent ailments. On average, clients need around 5 sessions, although some range from 1 to 10. Many people enjoy the therapy so much that they make it part of their quarterly health routine."
