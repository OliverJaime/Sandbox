      "testimonial": "After years of dealing with a noticeably compromised walk, Corryn and Dr Jack were so instrumental in restoring a fluid gait through their expertise in administering and monitoring robotic therapy. I was able to relax and actually enjoy a comfortable and heated therapy table during each session . I also benefited from just one dry needling treatment ——-there was significant reduction of pain  and intensity, which now allows me to walk down a flight of stairs with increased ease.   I SO appreciate all Corryn and Dr. Jack were able to do for me at Advanced Robotics Therapy.- Diane Collins",
